## Installation

### Setting up a virtual environment

1. If not already installed, [download python 3 from this website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Pip should be included in the python package, if not, [get pip from here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
3. Create a virtual environment by using the following command:
```
python3 -m venv mategaenv
```
Whereas "mategaenv" can be renamed to whatever you want.
**NOTE:** The python command might vary between systems. If `python3` doesn't work, try `py` instead if you're on a Windows machine.
this guide will use `python3` for commands, adapt where necessary.

4. 
* **Windows** users has to run the `activate.bat`-file within the `Scripts`-folder of their virtual environment via a terminal window to activate it.
* **Mac and GNU/Linux** users use the command `source path/to/bin/activate`, just replace `path/to` with the required folders. The bin-folder is directly inside the created
virtual environment.
5. Onwards!

### The website

**The next steps are implying that a virtual environment is activated**

1. Start by cloning the git repo (or fork it if that's your jam):
```
git clone https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/programvareutvikling-v19/gruppe-23.git
```
2. Enter the newly created `gruppe-23`-folder with a terminal window and run the following command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
If the `pip3` command doesn't work, use `pip` instead.

3. Create a database if nonexistant with the following command: 
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```
**NOTE: for safety reasons, the operational database located at `matega.recipes` is not included in the repo. Hence, you will only get a local test database.**

4. Start the local testing server with
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

5. Good luck!

You are free to make modifications and use them privately, without ever releasing them. 
This applies to organizations (including companies), too; 
an organization can make a modified version and use it internally without ever releasing it outside the organization.
